# Benchmark Configuration Audit

This document explains every major configuration used by the framework and by the current benchmark set. The framework is language-agnostic; the examples here refer to the BEAM benchmarks included in this repo.

---

## 1. max_connections (not set — Ranch default)

### What it is

- **Ranch/Cowboy option**: Maximum number of **concurrent TCP connections** the server will accept per listener.
- **Default in Ranch**: **1024** when not set.

### Current configuration

- **Canonical value**: **100_000** for parity with ulimit (see [CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md](CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md)). All Cowboy/Ranch-based benchmarks set `max_connections: 100_000` (or equivalent) so no server throttles before the FD limit.
- Yaws uses `max_connections = 100000` in config. Ranch/Cowboy use transport options (e.g. `{max_connections, 100000}` for Erlang; `transport_options: [max_connections: 100_000]` for Elixir).


## 2. ulimit / nofile (100,000)

### What it is

- **nofile**: Per-process limit on **number of open file descriptors** (includes sockets, files, pipes).
- **ulimit -n 100000**: In the shell, the current process (and its children) can open up to 100,000 FDs.
- **--ulimit nofile=100000:100000** (Docker): Soft and hard limit inside the container, both 100,000.

### Why it matters for benchmarking

- Each TCP connection is a file descriptor. Many concurrent connections ⇒ many FDs.
- If the limit is low (e.g. default 1024), the process hits “too many open files” and cannot accept more connections.
- **100,000** is chosen for high-concurrency load (same order of magnitude as your request counts in full runs).

### Where it is configured

| Location | How | Purpose |
|----------|-----|--------|
| **run_benchmarks.sh** | `ulimit -n 100000` at top | Host process (script + Python tools) can open many FDs (e.g. many client connections). |
| **check_health.sh** | `ulimit -n 100000` at top | Same for health-check session. |
| **measure_docker.py** | `--ulimit nofile=100000:100000` in `docker run` | Containers used for HTTP benchmarks get 100k FDs. |
| **measure_websocket.py** | `--ulimit nofile=100000:100000` in `docker run` | Containers used for WebSocket benchmarks get 100k FDs. |
| **check_health.sh** | `docker run ... --ulimit nofile=100000:100000 ...` | Health-check containers get 100k FDs. |
| **Container start.sh** (some) | `ulimit -n 100000` | Extra safety inside container (e.g. Elixir/Gleam); Docker already sets the limit. |
| **Health check** | `ulimit -n` inside container must be ≥ 100000 | Script fails the container if the effective limit is lower. |

So: **host scripts and all benchmark/health containers are consistently set to 100,000 open files.**  
This supports high concurrency; Cowboy/Ranch listeners use their default connection limit (1024) unless you set max_connections.

### Summary

- **What**: Per-process limit on open file descriptors (sockets, etc.).
- **Why**: Avoid “too many open files” when running many concurrent connections.
- **Recommendation**: Keep 100000 everywhere; only lower if you explicitly want to test under a lower FD limit.

---

## 3. Port configuration

### Host port (8001)

- **Default**: `HOST_PORT=8001` (in `run_benchmarks.sh` and `check_health.sh`).
- **Meaning**: On the host, all benchmark and health-check containers are mapped to **port 8001** (one container at a time).
- **Override**: e.g. `HOST_PORT=8002 make run-super-quick` to use another port.

### Container port (80)

- **EXPOSE 80** in every benchmark Dockerfile.
- Scripts read EXPOSE from the Dockerfile and build the mapping `HOST_PORT:80` (e.g. `8001:80`).
- So: **host 8001 → container 80** for HTTP and WebSocket.

### Summary

- **What**: One host port (8001) for all runs; container port 80.
- **Why**: Simple, consistent; avoids port conflicts as long as only one container runs at a time.
- **Recommendation**: Document in README that “port 8001 must be free during runs” and that `make clean-port PORT=8001` only affects Docker containers, not other apps.

---

## 4. HTTP benchmark: request counts

### What they control

- **Number of HTTP GET requests** sent to the server in each measurement.
- More requests ⇒ longer run, more stable throughput/energy averages, but longer total time.

### Where they are set

**scripts/run_benchmarks.sh:**

| Mode | Variable | Values | Use case |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| Full | `full_http_requests` | 100, 1000, 5000, 8000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000, 80000 | Full sweep; many points. |
| Quick | `quick_http_requests` | 1000, 5000, 10000 | Shorter run; 3 points. |
| Super-quick | `super_quick_http_requests` | 1000 | Single point; smoke test. |

- **measure_docker.py** receives `--num_requests` from the script; it does not hard-code counts.

### Summary

- **What**: How many requests per run (per container × per request-count).
- **Why**: Full = detailed curve; quick/super-quick = fast validation.
- **Recommendation**: Keep as is; document in README that “super-quick = 1000 requests per container” and “quick = 3 request counts (1000, 5k, 10k).”

---

## 5. WebSocket benchmark: clients, size, bursts, stream

### What they control

- **Burst**: N clients, each sending M bursts of K KB; interval between bursts.
- **Stream**: N clients, each sending at R messages/sec for D seconds; message size K KB.
- **Concurrency**: Vary number of clients (e.g. 100, 1000, 5000).
- **Payload**: Vary message size (e.g. 8, 1024, 65536 KB).

### Where they are set

**scripts/run_benchmarks.sh:**

- **Full**: `full_ws_burst_*`, `full_ws_stream_*` (e.g. clients 5,50,100; sizes 8,1024,65536 KB; etc.).
- **Quick / super-quick**: `quick_ws_burst_*`, `quick_ws_stream_*` (e.g. 5 clients, 8 KB, 1 burst; stream 1 msg/s, 1 s).
- **Concurrency**: `quick_concurrency_clients`, `concurrency_clients`.
- **Payload**: `quick_payload_*`, `payload_*`.

**tools/measure_websocket.py**: Reads `--clients`, `--size_kb`, `--bursts`, `--interval`, `--rate`, `--duration` from the script; no hard-coded defaults that override the script.

### Summary

- **What**: WebSocket load shape (clients, message size, rate, duration).
- **Why**: Test different concurrency and payload sizes; quick/super-quick reduce combinations.
- **Recommendation**: Document in README or BENCHMARKS_AUDIT that “super-quick WebSocket = 5 clients, 8 KB, 1 burst” and “full = multiple client counts and sizes.”

## 6. Health check: timeouts and wait

### Where they are set

**scripts/check_health.sh:**

- `TIMEOUT=30` (s) — overall per-container timeout.
- `STARTUP_WAIT=10` (s) — wait after start before first HTTP/WS check.
- Extra wait for some stacks: e.g. Cowboy/Erlang/Elixir/Phoenix +5 s; Gleam +20 s (compile on first run).
- `HTTP_TIMEOUT=10` (s) — curl timeout for HTTP.

### Summary

- **What**: How long we wait for the container to be “ready” and respond.
- **Why**: BEAM apps (especially Elixir/Gleam) can need a few seconds to boot; Gleam may compile.
- **Recommendation**: Keep; document that “health check waits 10–30 s per container depending on stack.”

## 7. Scaphandre and measurement

- **Scaphandre**: Started with `sudo scaphandre json --containers -f <file>`; runs for the duration of the measurement.
- **Container detection**: Scripts prefer Scaphandre's `container.name` field. When Scaphandre reports `container: null` for all consumers (e.g. cgroups v2, Debian 13), a **cgroup fallback** attributes energy by matching `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` against the Docker container ID. We rely on this fallback until Scaphandre updates container detection. Track progress: [Scaphandre issue #420](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre/issues/420).
- **No TTY**: Script runs without a terminal; sudo must be pre-authenticated or passwordless for scaphandre.
- **Energy 0.00 J**: If energy is always 0, ensure Scaphandre runs on the host. The cgroup fallback requires the container to still be running when parsing (handled automatically).

## 8. Consistency summary and recommendations

**See [docs/CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md](CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md) for canonical values and full parity matrix.**

| Setting | Intended value | Inconsistency / note |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **num_acceptors / acceptor_pool_size** | 8 | Canonical; set in all Cowboy/Ranch and Yaws. |
| **max_connections** | 100,000 | Canonical; set in all Cowboy/Ranch and Yaws. |
| **ulimit / nofile** | 100,000 | Consistent in scripts and Docker. |
| **Port** | Host 8001, container 80 | Consistent; EXPOSE 80 everywhere. |
| **Request counts** | Script-defined (full/quick/super-quick) | Consistent; only the script defines them. |
| **WebSocket params** | Script-defined | Consistent. |

### For a green engineer

1. **Configuration parity**: All servers use canonical values (num_acceptors=8, max_connections=100000). See [CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md](CONFIGURATION_PARITY.md).
2. **ulimit 100000**: Do not lower it if you run high-concurrency or full benchmarks.
3. **Changing load (requests, WebSocket params)**: Prefer changing only in **scripts/run_benchmarks.sh** (one place); tools should keep taking args from the script.
4. **Changing port**: Use **HOST_PORT**; ensure nothing else uses that port during the run (clean-port only clears Docker containers).
5. **Documentation**: Keep README and this CONFIGURATION_AUDIT in sync when you add or change a global limit or port.

## 9. Where each configuration lives (quick reference)

- **scripts/run_benchmarks.sh**: HOST_PORT, ulimit, HTTP request arrays, WebSocket arrays (burst/stream/concurrency/payload).
- **scripts/check_health.sh**: HOST_PORT, ulimit, TIMEOUT, STARTUP_WAIT, HTTP_TIMEOUT, docker run --ulimit.
- **tools/measure_docker.py**: docker run --ulimit nofile=100000:100000, port from args.
- **tools/measure_websocket.py**: docker run --ulimit nofile=100000:100000, port from args.
- **Benchmark app code**: Port 80 in Cowboy/Ranch listeners; max_connections not set (Ranch default). Other stacks use their own listener config (but still EXPOSE 80).

This file is the single place that ties all of these together for a green computer benchmark engineer.
